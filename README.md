# liri-node-app

Homework Assignment number 8

In this assignment we are to create LIRI.  LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface which is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives back data.  

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI but instead of getting back speech interpretaion data we get back language interpretation data.

We will be using Twitter, Spotify and OMDB API's which should be able to take in one of these commands:

'my tweets' - This will show your last 20 tweets and when they were created in your terminal/bash window. 


'spotify-this-song'- This will show  the following information about the song in your terminal/bash window
                        
                        Artist(s)
                        The song's name
                        A preview link of the song from Spotify
                        The album that the song is from


'movie-this'- This will output the following information to your terminal/bash window:

   * Title of the movie.
   * Year the movie came out.
   * IMDB Rating of the movie.
   * Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie.
   * Country where the movie was produced.
   * Language of the movie.
   * Plot of the movie.
   * Actors in the movie.


'do-what-it-says'- Using the fs Node package, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's                          commands.  It should run spotify-this-song for "I Want it That Way," as follows the text in random.txt.
